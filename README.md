This is a basic recipe website made using The Odin Project's curriculum.
It is intended to show my grasp of Git, pushing projects to a GitHub repository, as well as basic HTML web design.
This is my first public project, and hopefully I will continue to grow and expand this skill set as I complete the curriculum I'm following.
